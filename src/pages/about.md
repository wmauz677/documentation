![](/img/me.jpg)  |  Hello, my name is Weston Mauz, though most of my friends call me Weast (pronounced 'east' with a 'w'). I am a mechanical engineer / software developer from Golden, Colorado, U.S.A. <br/><br/> On May 5, 2021, I embarked on an 18-month engineering assignment in Taiwan with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). I will be stationed in the city of Tainan, where I will be trained to learn the most modern process of semiconductor manufacturing. <br/><br/> This blog will be a representation of what I see, experience, and learn while in the East. I will not glamorize the experience, nor display this time as fantasy. I intend to keep these depictions raw and unfiltered. <br/><br/> I look forward to sharing my experience with you.
